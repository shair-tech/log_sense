#+TITLE: Todo

* Todo (2024-08-01)
** T Show page with method
   - we could generate a page with the result of the calls to a given method
     (how many calls, distribution, ...). This would be the "show" of a rails app.
     
** T Break rails log_parser in subclasses (one per log type)

** T Distinguish between exceptions, errors with no timestamps and errors with timestamps  :feature:
   - In rails reports some errors don't have a timestamp, whereas other have.

   1. Check whether we can always get an ID of an event

** T Move geolocation to aggregator, so that we can perform queries more efficiently  :refactoring:
** T Filter on dates                                                :feature:
** T Visits/Hits                                                    :feature: 
   - Visits and hits now includes also requests for other resources and 404.
     We should probably limit to the visits to actual pages, to remove noise
     and errors.
** T error on data
   - The data reported by echarts on the number of hits of a controller
     differs from the data shown in the table?
** T Remove dependency from Zurb Foundation (native css grid instead) :refactoring:
** T refactor report specifications in their own class          :refactoring:
** T Add lines not parsed to the report                             :feature:
** T Using an empty log as input raises an error                    :feature:

** T Architecture                                               :refactoring: 
   The architecture and the structure of the code is far from being nice,
   for historical reason and for a bunch of small differences existing
   between the input and the outputs to be generated.  This usually ends
   up with modifications to the code that have to be replicated in
   different parts of the code and in interferences.

   Among the points I would like to address:

   - [ ] The execution pipeline in the main script has a few exceptions to
     manage SQLite reading/dumping and ufw report.  A linear structure
     would be a lot nicer.

   - [ ] Two different classes are defined for steps 1, 2, and 4, to manage,
     respectively, Apache and Rails logs.  These classes inherit from a common
     ancestor (e.g. ApacheParser and RailsParser both inherit from Parser), but
     there is still too little code shared.  A nicer approach would be that of
     identifying a common DB structure and unify the pipeline up to (or
     including) the generation of reports. There are a bunch of small different
     things to highlight in reports, which still make this difficult.  For
     instance, the country report for Apache reports size of TX data, which is
     not available for Rail reports.

   - [ ] Geolocation could become a lot more efficient if performed in
     SQLite, rather than in Ruby

   - [ ] The distinction between Aggregation, Shaping, and Emission is a too
     fine-grained and it would be nice to be able to cleanly remove one
     of the steps.
