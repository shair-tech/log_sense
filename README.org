* Introduction

LogSense generates reports and statistics from Ruby on Rails and Apache/Nginx
log files.

Main features:

- Statistics for Rails app in production and Web server logs (combined format,
  which can be produced both by Apache and Nginx)
- Reports on performances, errors, visitors, and devices used to access your
  websites and webapps[fn:: LogSense parses also the data generated by the
  BrowserInfo gem, providing additional information for Rails apps, including
  devices, platforms and number of accesses to methods by device type.].
- Can combine one or more log files
- No need for cookies or other tracking technologies (but you need access to
  your log files)
- Filters allow to analyze specific periods distinguish traffic generated by
  self polls and crawlers.
- Reports can be generated in HTML, txt, ufw, and SQLite.  HTML reports are
  responsive and come with dark and light theme.

LogSense is Written in Ruby, it runs from the command line, it is fast, and it
can be installed on any system with a relatively recent version of Ruby.  We
use it with Ruby 3.1.4 and 3.3.0.

It is fast. On a ThinkPad P16, a 277M log file is parsed in 15 seconds,
processing, that is, about 7740 events per second; a 569M log file is parsed in
50 seconds, that is, about 4700 events per second.


** Rails Production Report

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 80%
[[file:./screenshots/rails-screenshot.png]]

LogSense understands the Rails *production log* and generates the following
reports in TXT and HTML:

- Daily Distribution
- Time Distribution
- Statuses
- Statuses by Day
- Rails Performance
- Controller and Methods by Device
- Fatal Events
- Fatal Events
- Fatal Events (grouped by type)
- Job Error
- Job Errors (grouped) 
- Browsers
- Platforms
- IPs
- Countries
- IP per hour
- Sessions

** Apache/Nginx Report

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 80%
[[file:./screenshots/combined_log-screenshot.png]]

LogSense reads the Apache/Nginx *combined log* format and generates the
following reports in TXT and HTML:

- Time Distribution
- 20_ and 30_ on HTML pages
- 20_ and 30_ on other resources
- 40_ and 50_x on HTML pages
- 40_ and 50_ on other resources
- 40_ and 50_x on HTML pages by IP
- 40_ and 50_ on other resources by IP
- Statuses
- Statuses by Day
- Browsers
- Platforms
- IPs
- Countries
- IP per hour
- Combined Platform Data
- Referers
- Sessions

** UFW Report

The =ufw= output format generates directives for Uncomplicated Firewall,
blacklisting IPs requesting URLs matching a given pattern.

We use it to blacklist IPs requesting WordPress login pages on our
websites... since we don't use WordPress for our websites.

*Example*

#+begin_src 
$ log_sense -f apache -t ufw -i apache.log
# /users/sign_in/xmlrpc.php?rsd
ufw deny from 20.212.3.206

# /wp-login.php /wordpress/wp-login.php /blog/wp-login.php /wp/wp-login.php
ufw deny from 185.255.134.18

...
#+end_src

* Installation

  #+begin_src bash
  gem install log_sense
  #+end_src

  If you want to collect information about browsers, platform and devices when
  generating Rails reports, add the =browser= gem to your bundle and the
  following code to =application_controller.rb=:

  #+begin_example ruby
  # Gemfile
  gem "browser"
  #+end_example

  #+begin_example ruby
  # application_controller.rb
  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  
    # [...]

    before_action do |controller|
      user_agent = request.env['HTTP_USER_AGENT']
      ip = request.env['REMOTE_ADDR']

      hashed_ip = Digest::SHA256.hexdigest ip
      b = Browser.new(user_agent)
      now = DateTime.now

      logger = Rails.logger
      browser_data = [
        b.name, b.platform, b.device.name,
        controller.class.name, controller.action_name,
        request.format.symbol,
        hashed_ip,
        now
      ]

      browser_data_str = browser_data.map { |x| "\"#{x}\"" }.join(',')
      logger.info "BrowserInfo: #{browser_data_str}"
    end

    # [...]
  end
  #+end_example

  #+begin_src bash :results raw output :wrap example :exports both
  log_sense --help

* Motivation

LogSense focuses on *privacy*, *data-ownership*, and *simplicity*: no need to
install JavaScript snippets, no tracking cookies, just plain and simple log
analysis.

LogSense is also inspired by *static websites generators*: statistics are
generated from the command line and accessed as static HTML files.  This
significantly reduces the attack surface of your web server and installation
headaches.  We have a cron job running on our servers, generating statistics at
night.  The generated files are then made available on a private area on the
web and rotated monthly.

* An important word of warning on SQLite3 output

[[https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Log_Injection][Log poisoning]] is a technique whereby attackers send requests with invalidated
user input to forge log entries or inject malicious content into the logs.

log_sense sanitizes entries of HTML reports, to try and protect from log
poisoning.  *Log entries and URLs in SQLite3 tables, however, are not
sanitized*: they are read and stored from the log as they are.  This is not, in
general, an issue, unless you use the unsanitized data from SQLite as it is in
environments where URL can be opened or code executed using the URLs as
argument.

* Change Log

See the [[file:CHANGELOG.org][CHANGELOG]] file.

* Compatibility

LogSense should run on any system on which a recent version of Ruby
runs.  We tested it with Ruby 2.6.9 and Ruby 3.0.x, and Ruby 3.3.x

* Credits

- HTML reports use [[https://get.foundation/][Zurb Foundation]], [[https://www.datatables.net/][Data Tables]], and [[https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html][Apache ECharts]]
- The textual format is compatible with [[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]] and can be further processed to
  any format [[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]] can be exported to, including HTML and PDF, with the word
  of warning in the section above concerning log poisoning.

* Code Structure

The code implements a pipeline, with the following steps:

  1. *Parser:* parses a log to a SQLite3 database. The database
     contains a table with a list of events, and, in the case of Rails
     report, a table with the errors.
  2. *Aggregator:* takes as input a SQLite DB and aggregates data,
      typically performing "group by", which are simpler to generate in
      Ruby, rather than in SQL.  The module outputs a Hash, with
      different reporting data.
  3. *GeoLocator:* add country information to all the reporting data
      which has an IP as one the fields.
  4. *Shaper:* makes (geolocated) aggregated data (e.g. Hashes and
      such), into Array of Arrays, simplifying the structure of the code
      building the reports.
  5. *Emitter* generates reports from shaped data using ERB.
